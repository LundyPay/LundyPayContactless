## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please email info@lundypay.com with the subject line of "LundyPay Contactless Vulnerability".

We will try to confirm receipt of your vulnerability report within 3 working days.

Once we have received a report of a vulnerability we will attempt to reproduce the issue and determine whether to accept or decline the vulnerability.

Once we have made this determination we will reply to your email with our decision and possibly an explanation in case we haven't accepted the vulnerability.

If we accept the vulnerability report. we will attempt to patch the vulnerability and ask that you test the patched code to see if the vulnerability still affects it.
If the vulnerability no longer affects it we will then release an updated version of the application to both F-Droid and Google Play Store, and report on the vulnerability (as well as your help in identifying it) after the app has passed Google Play Store checks and has been sent to users.

If the vulnerability still affects the code, we will attempt to patch the vulnerability again and re-test the new patched code to see if the vulnerability still affects it. If it does we may reach out to you requesting further information on the nature of the vulnerability and how it works.

If you have submitted a vulnerability please do not discuss this with others unless we decline the vulnerability report or have already given you permission to discuss the vulnerability (owing to the update being sent to users).

Failure to comply with this may result in disciplinary action being taken against you such as but is not limited to banning you from our discussion groups or our online communities.
